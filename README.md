Visualization of Stigmergetic Project
=====================================

- Open architecture, asynchrone open research participation
- People come and go and are never in phase.
- Goal is real: Imagine, explore, learn, produce, build.
- Multimedia content created can be forked, mixed, mashed, merged, reprocessed, curated, republished in multple forms
- Structure is fluid.
- Knowledge and `possibilities for action' are produced ongoingly that need to be kept track of and acted upon.
- People enter through different doors.
- Some need guidance others autonomy, need 'built in' governance and decision making
- A game or 3D interactive possibility 'catalogue'? Visualizing Stigmergy in the making
- In the end there are two products that must be built and evolve: the visualization of the project, and the project itself

Various conceptual inspirations of visualization [here](https://github.com/HeleneFi/Holoptic-Borderspace-Visualization): how parts of a whole can see the whole evolve and the relationships between parts in action, where gaps can be identified, needs fulfilled, possibilities explored and impacts vizualized.
